Prediction of customer eligibility for credit using Machine Learning

Here we will predict the customer eligibility for credit using various Algorithm, and see which is suitable by comparing their performance

• Here I have used a large data set of Taiwan customers and predicted the case of customer’s default payments
   
• I have applied different Machine Learning Algorithm like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K - Fold Cross Validation, Random Forest, K - Nearest Neighbor and Artificial Neural Network etc.
   
• After calculating and seeing all the performance, I got highest accuracy by using Artificial Neural Network Algorithm
